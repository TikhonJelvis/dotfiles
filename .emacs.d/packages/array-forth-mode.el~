;;; Commentary:

;; This is a mode for editing arrayForth files. This is the dialect
;; of forth used by GreenArray chips. Normal forth syntax is used
;; internally and exported to the colorForth format via some external
;; Python scripts. The syntax coloring reflects the colorForth style
;; colors arrayForth uses.
